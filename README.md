# My Personal Gadget Workspace

This workspace is a collection of Python projects and scripts, primarily focused on creating various small applications and tools related to myself.

## Workspace Structure

The workspace is organized as follows:

*   `personal_profile_project/`: Contains a web application for a personal profile page.
    *   `app.py`: The main Flask application file.
    *   `templates/`: HTML templates for the website.
    *   `static/`: Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images).
    *   `README.md`: Specific instructions for the personal profile project.
*   `scripts/`: This directory is intended for standalone Python scripts that perform specific tasks.
*   `modules/`: This directory is for reusable Python modules that can be imported by scripts in `scripts/` or other projects within this workspace. It contains an `__init__.py` to make it a package.
*   `data/`: For storing any data files (e.g., CSV, JSON, text files) used by the scripts or projects.
*   `tests/`: Intended for unit tests for the various modules and scripts.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python package dependencies for projects in this workspace. (Note: The `personal_profile_project` might have its own specific `requirements.txt` or manage dependencies if it were a more complex, isolated project).
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

## Goal

The main goal of this workspace is to house various small, potentially "trivial," projects and scripts that I create for personal use, experimentation, or learning.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable).**
2.  **Set up a Python virtual environment.** It's recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows (PowerShell):
    # .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    # On Windows (Command Prompt):
    # .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    # On macOS/Linux:
    # source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Navigate to specific project/script directories to run them.** For example, to run the personal profile website:
    ```bash
    cd personal_profile_project
    python app.py
    ```
